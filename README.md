# Analyzing Spotify Songs

The aim of this work is to analyze music. Utilizing the acoustic features that Spotify provides for songs, we will look into a couple of data mining algorithms, namely popularity and genre prediction, and provide some interesting visualizations, about some fun aspects of music and some intertemporal trends.

In this work, a couple of datasets that contain information about a sample of hundreds of thousands of songs that are currently on Spotify will be used, in conjuction with the API that Spotify provides.
